# ENGO651 Lab 3 – Calgary Building Permits Web Map

This project is a web mapping application that visualizes building permits in Calgary using the City of Calgary Open Data API. The application allows users to search for building permits within a selected date range and display them on an interactive map.

The project uses **Leaflet.js** for mapping and combines data from the Open Calgary API to build a simple geospatial web application.

# Features

## Interactive Map
When the webpage loads, a Leaflet map centered on Calgary is displayed using OpenStreetMap tiles.

## Date Range Search
Users can select a date range using a **Flatpickr date picker** and search for building permits issued during that time.

The application sends a request to the Calgary Open Data API and retrieves permits within the selected date range.

## Permit Markers
Each building permit returned from the API is displayed as a marker on the map.

## Permit Information Popup
Clicking a marker displays detailed information about the permit, including:

- issueddate  
- workclassgroup  
- contractorname  
- communityname  
- originaladdress  

## Marker Clustering
When many permits appear in the same area, markers are grouped using the **Leaflet MarkerCluster plugin**. This improves map readability and performance.

## Overlapping Marker Handling
Some permits share the same coordinates. The application uses the **OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier plugin** to spread markers apart when clicked so users can select individual permits.

## Clear Search
The **Clear button** removes all markers from the map and resets the search input.
